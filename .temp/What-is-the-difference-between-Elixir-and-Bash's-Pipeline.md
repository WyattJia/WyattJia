As you know, Elixir is a functional programming language, which built on BEAM(Erlang VM). Elixir's syntax is similar to a mixture of Ruby and Erlang. But both Ruby and Erlang have no *Pipeline* syntax, only bash has *Pipeline* syntax. So I want to know the difference between Elixir and Bash's *Pipeline*, and why Ruby or Erlang have no *Pipeline*.

## Bash's Pipeline.
Bash's Pipeline  syntax is used to `|` symbol.
